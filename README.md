# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

- `assets`: contains any static assets that are used in the application, such as images.
- `components`: contains individual Vue components that make up the UI.
- `views`: contains Vue views, which are combinations of components that make up the application's pages.
- `router`: contains the Vue Router configuration, which is used to define the application's routes.
- `store`: (optional) contains the Vuex store, which is used to manage the global state of the application.
- `api`: (optional) contains API files that handle communication with a server or external API.
- `utils`: (optional) contains utility files that provide helper functions or reusable code.

This is just a basic structure, and it can vary depending on the size and complexity of the project. You can add or remove directories and files based on the needs of your project.
